    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Our mission is to empower farmers with the knowledge and tools they need to optimize their crop yields and improve their livelihoods. We believe that technology can play a crucial role in transforming agriculture and making it more sustainable and productive.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>We envision a future where every farmer can make data-driven decisions to maximize their crop yields and contribute to global food security. Our goal is to make advanced agricultural technology accessible to farmers worldwide.</p>

    <h2>Our Team</h2>
    <p>Our system was developed by Anshika Jain, a dedicated and passionate developer who is currently in her final year of BTech in Computer Science and Engineering at Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad. Anshika has a deep interest in machine learning and its applications in agriculture, and she has worked tirelessly to bring this project to life.</p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>The idea for our Crop Recommendation System was born out of a desire to help farmers make better decisions about their crops. We started this project as a small initiative and have since grown into a comprehensive platform that combines data science and agriculture.</p>

    <h2>Our Technology</h2>
    <p>We use advanced machine learning techniques to analyze various factors like soil composition, weather patterns, and historical data to provide accurate crop recommendations. Our system integrates state-of-the-art algorithms to deliver reliable and actionable insights.</p>

    <h2>Our Impact</h2>
    <p>Since its launch, our Crop Recommendation System has helped numerous farmers optimize their crop production and increase their incomes. We are proud of the positive impact we have made and continue to strive for greater reach and effectiveness.</p>

    <h2>Awards and Recognitions</h2>
    <p>Our project has been recognized by various industry bodies for its innovation and impact in the field of agricultural technology.</p>

    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p>We are working on adding new features to our system, including real-time weather updates and more granular soil analysis, to provide even better recommendations for farmers.</p>
